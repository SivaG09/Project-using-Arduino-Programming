## PANIC BUTTON ON TWO WHEELER'S.
### The project aims to develop safety and security for women while driving two wheelerâ€™s. 
An alarming device is set up in such a way that it can be operated easily by women when in distress. This device can send an alert message and simultaneously raise an alarm. It is a device that lets the user send an alert message to quickly convey about the situation to their closed one by using GSM and GPS and seek for help from the people around them with the help of a high decibel buzzer. This can also be used as an emergency button for all the riders who use the vehicle at times of difficulties.
